            <p>I am currently a Chiropractic Assistant, and manage our website and social media accounts. I
                love a new
                challenge and the challenge of learning new things. My daughter is my main motivation to go back to
                school and get a better job so I can show her how hard work pays off. When I am not working you can find
                me baking or
                experiementing with a new recipe in the kitchen. I also enjoy spending time outside with my family, when
                it's not 10,000 degrees. I am of the mind set that cats
                are the best, especially exotic cats. I can't own a tiger like Carol Baskin so instead I own a bengal
                cat
                named Nova
