    <p>I am currently a Chiropractic Assistant, and manage our website and social media accounts. I love a new challenge and the challenge of learning new things. My daughter is my main motivation to go back to school and get a better
        job so
        I can show her how hard work pays off</p>

    <p>When I am not working you can find me baking or experiementing with a new recipe in the kitchen. I also enjoy
        spending time outside with my family, when it's not 10,000 degrees. I am of the mind set that cats are the best,
        especially exotic cats. I can't own a tiger like Carol Baskin so instead I own a bengal cat named Nova</p>
